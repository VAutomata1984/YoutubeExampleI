# Youtube Homepage Replica with HTML/CSS
Repo Owner: Matthew Vollo (vollomatthew@gmail.com) 


This is a replica of the Youtube Homepage that I made with HTML/CSS. I used actual videos from my reccomended at the time. In addition to basic functionality, I also programmed it so that if you were to click on the of the links on the page, you would be directed to the actual youtube link. Similarly, I also added search functionality, and kept the homepage up to date with the style that the current youtube homepage has. 

I followed this tutorial for the basics of this page: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3e-cpL7ofc&list=WL&index=57&t=2466s&pp=gAQBiAQB
